if your boot partition needs more space and it can make you life hard :)
 you have several options :

 1. using a bootable drive and arch iso to generate a new kernel build and solve it (until full space)
 2. dissable update (until systemd crashes)
 3. remove fall back and unessray files (fallback)
 4. make the boot partition biger and change uuid in fstab (recommended)
